In this tutorial we'll show you how you can create an onboarding flow that starts a pathway.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure that you're calling the correct [endpoint](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/endpoints) and have an [API key to authorize your requests](/awell-orchestration/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/authorization)
2. Fire up a demo app, use our [Playground](/awell-orchestration/api-reference/overview/playground), or [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19166134/UVXnGEJb) to follow along

## Guide

### Get patient information

Every pathway needs to be associated to a patient resource meaning that in order to start a pathway you need to know who you're starting a pathway for. We support [anonymous patients](/api-reference/mutations/create-patient#support-for-anonymous-patients), however, so you are able to create a patient resource without any personal identifiable information associated to it.

### Collect baseline information

Pathways can have baseline data points, these are data points you want to pass a value for on pathway start.

> **Example:**
>
> You want to have an onboarding form for your diabetes pathway which could have the following baseline data points:
>
> - Date of diagnosis
> - Type of diabetes
>
> This would be information you collect in your onboarding form and pass to the Awell API on pathway start.

Baseline data points are defined on the pathway level and you can query the baseline data points needed for a pathway via the `publishedPathwayDefinitions` query.

> **Note:** baseline data points can only be added to a pathway by the Awell staff.

```graphql
query publishedPathwayDefinitions {
  publishedPathwayDefinitions {
    publishedPathwayDefinitions {
      id
      title
      dataPointDefinitions {
        id
        key
        valueType
        optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query returns all published pathway definitions in your tenant so you need to do a find on `id` to get the baseline data points of the pathway you're interested in (you'll need the [`pathway_definition_id`](/awell-orchestration/docs/getting-started/concepts-and-terminology#pathway-definition-id) to do the find on the `id ` field).

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "publishedPathwayDefinitions": {
      "publishedPathwayDefinitions": [
        {
          "id": "nnTEiRnjmkNg",
          "title": "Knee Replacement Pathway",
          "dataPointDefinitions": []
        },
        {
          "id": "S7YmVI-Dfw9c",
          "title": "Diabetes pathway",
          "dataPointDefinitions": [
            {
              "id": "7VayqN8q_-pF",
              "key": "date_of_diagnosis",
              "valueType": "DATE",
              "optional": null
            },
            {
              "id": "NUgl3pgKm0G3",
              "key": "type_of_diabetes",
              "valueType": "STRING",
              "optional": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can either use the fields in `dataPointDefinitions` to dynamically render a form that has inputs for all baseline data points or manually compose a form and map the inputs to the correct data point definition id when starting a pathway.

### Create patient

When you have the patient's information and the baseline data points, you need to create the patient first and then start the pathway. Note that it needs to be done in this order as to start a pathway you need to pass the id of the patient you want to start the pathway for.

  href="/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/create-patient"
  className="button"

</a>

**Query:**

```graphql
mutation createPatient($input: CreatePatientInput!) {
  createPatient(input: $input) {
    patient {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "first_name": "{{PATIENT FIRST NAME}}",
    "last_name": "{{PATIENT LAST NAME}}",
    "patient_code": "{{PATIENT CODE}}",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createPatient": {
      "patient": {
        "id": "_Ntnp0fnUy8AVJdWSNuAB"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Start pathway

<a
  href="/awell-orchestration/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway"
  className="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open startPathway mutation documentation"
>
  Open startPathway mutation documentation
</a>

**Query:**

```graphql
mutation startPathway($input: StartPathwayInput!) {
  startPathway(input: $input) {
    pathway_id
  }
}
```

**Variables:**

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_id": "_Ntnp0fnUy8AVJdWSNuAB",
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "data_points": [
      {
        "data_point_definition_id": "7VayqN8q_-pF",
        "value": "2015-05-02"
      },
      {
        "data_point_definition_id": "NUgl3pgKm0G3",
        "value": "Type 1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `patient_id` is the id returned from the create patient mutation and the [`{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}`]({{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}) is the unique identifier of your pathway.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "startPathway": {
      "pathway_id": "sXTB2r9wVbFl"
    }
  }
}
```
