## Pathways

A pathway refers to the collection of tracks, steps, and actions that will define the patients journey.

### Pathway definition id

The `pathway_definition_id` is a unique identifier for a pathway as generated during pathway design.

> When you create a new pathway in Awell Studio, a `pathway_definition_id` is autogenerated by the system and can be found by looking at the URL: `https://studio.awellhealth.com/pathways/{pathwayDefinitionId}`.

### Pathway id

Every patient enrolled in a pathway (i.e. pathway definition) has a unique `pathway_id`.

> We have a "Knee surgery" pathway that has the following pathway_definition_id: `owMPjuQrYbg7`. Patient A is included in that pathway and the pathway id is `TJV9kt9b_4E3`.

**To summarize:**

1. The `pathway_definition_id` identifies what pathway we're talking about.
2. The `pathway_id` is always linked to the context of a patient included in a given pathway definition. Patients included in the same pathway have the same `pathway_definition_id` but have a different `pathway_id`.

## Orchestration

Orchestration of a pathway means executing a pathway that we built in Awell Studio. The Orchestration API is responsible for navigating through a pathway and identifying what is next for the patient, based on logic defined in the pathway design.

## Activities

Activities are the key units of interaction with the pathway as patient travels through the various steps of their care journey.

While orchestrating, our Orchestration API handles the logic for computing next steps and navigating the patient correctly through the pathway, meaning you only need to check for and handle pending activities for each patient.

These activities are assigned to the appropriate stakeholder and can be completed by them.

There are multiple activity types supported by the Awell Orchestration API, including:

- Calculations
- Checklists
- Forms
- Messages

### Structure of an activity

Activities use a generic structure (subject + action + object + indirect object) to describe any action that needs to be performed by a human or system.

```graphql
{
  id # activity identifier
  stream_id # pathway identifier
  date
  subject {
    id
    type
    name
  }
  action
  object {
    id
    type
    name
  }
  indirect_object {
    id
    type
    name
  }
}
```

## Forms

Forms activities allow data to be collected from a pathway stakeholder, whether a member of the care team or a patient. Forms are assigned to one stakeholder to complete.

They can be built flexibly and update dynamically, meaning that questions can be optional and/or shown only if a condition is met.

## Data points

All the data captured in a pathway comes with a strongly typed data point definition, which allows you to both define (when building a pathway) and understand (when receiving captured data points) what this data means.

```typescript
interface DataPointDefinition {
  id: string
  key: string
  category:
    | 'pathway'
    | 'step'
    | 'track'
    | 'form'
    | 'calculation'
    | 'patient_profile'
  valueType: 'boolean' | 'date' | 'number' | 'string' | 'numbers_array'
  unit?: string
  possibleValues?: Array<{
    value: string
    label?: string
  }>
  range?: {
    min?: number
    max?: number
  }
}
```
