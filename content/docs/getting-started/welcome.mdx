## What is Awell?

Awell offers an easy way to build and operate clinical workflows. Automate work and deliver evidence-based care with powerful flows that make care teams and patients move as one.

## How Awell works

Awell has 3 fundamental pieces to it:

- **Build & Iterate**: clinical and product experts can build and iterate on care flows using forms, checklists, rich messaging, scoring algorithms and conditional logic with our drag & drop builder.
- **Validate & Train**: manage care flow versions, validate them, train the care team and publish for go live.
- **Operate**: own the end-user experience and use our APIs to feed your patient and care teams apps with the next steps, the next information to show or the next data to capture.
