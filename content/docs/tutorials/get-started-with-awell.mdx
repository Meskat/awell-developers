import { LinkButton } from '../../../src/components/Button'

This guide aims to familiarise you with using and testing Awellâ€™s sandbox environment and some basic resources, through a guided walkthrough. We will create a patient, start a pathway for them that measures their BMI and handle form and message activities to progress the patient to the end of the pathway.

## How to use this quickstart

Postman is our recommended way of testing the library, as we have configured this collection to allow you to run it consecutively without needing to manually update request inputs. We'll let you know whenever we do this for you so you aren't missing any key information.

The collection also supports code generation so you can easily see examples below in whatever language you may be using to make the requests. Just select your preferred language at the top of this page to change what code snippets you see.

### Support

For questions, bug reports, and discussions about our API development, get in touch with us via Intercom (icon in the bottom right corner) or your Awell point of contact if you have one.

## Requirements

### Awell Studio account and API key

You should have received an invitation to the Awell Studio account to create the pathway used in this tutorial. You will also have received an API key to authenticate each request made.

This key can be added to the collection variables in Postman and set up so that each request in the collection will automatically include it in the request header. You can learn about defining collection variables in Postman [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#defining-collection-variables).

You can then set up the API key in the collection Auth tab in Postman. Note that the variable name (`AUTH_API_KEY`) in the Value input must match the name you used in the collection Variables tab. Alternatively, you can ente the API key directly here.

Once that is done, you are ready to proceed.

### Create a care pathway on Awell Studio

For this tutorial, we will create a simple BMI calculation pathway. First we need to create that pathway definition in the Awell Studio.

Once you have logged into the [Awell Studio](https://studio.sandbox.awellhealth.com/), click on the "Create Pathway" button on the top right. Enter a pathway name (e.g. BMI Calculation Demo) and click "Create Pathway." You will be redirected to a pathway management page. Click on the "Default track" in the table to open up the pathway builder.

Refer to this [loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/39c562eafe694222b05383240ed04ae0) for the next steps.

### Publish your care pathway

Once the pathway has been created, we need to publish the pathway in order to be used for Orchestration. Have a look at [this loom](https://www.loom.com/share/af3d74b9308c4e6d87034ff2b33e6b81) video to see how you can publish a pathway.

Make note of the pathway definition id, you will need to add it to your collection variables. It is the trailing stem on the pathway details page: `studio.sandbox.awellhealth.com/pathways/:pathway_definition_id`. Add this to your collection variables as the initial value for `PUBLISHED_PATHWAY_ID`.

That is all the setup required for this tutorial. We're now ready to create a patient and orchestrate!

## Tutorial

### Create patient

Let's start with creating our first patient! To create a patient, you can use the `CreatePatient` mutation to set up a patient and associated profile.

<a
  href="/api-reference/mutations/create-patient"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for CreatePatient mutation"
>
  Open API reference for CreatePatient mutation
</a>

As all of the fields are optional, this means, in effect, that you can create anonymous patients should you need to. For example, you can begin a patient journey with no details provided except an internal patient_code reference and use the generated patient ID to progress them through a pathway until such time you wish to gather and update their personal details.

In the request below, we will start with a patient called Henrietta Lacks. Update the request body accordingly and send it to see the response and newly generated patient ID.

> If you are using the Postman collection, we will automatically set a collection variable called PATIENT_ID with the patient id received. You will need to note down and include this as needed in future requests where you see `{{ PATIENT_ID }}` in the GraphQL request body if you are not using Postman.

```graphql
mutation createPatient($input: CreatePatientInput!) {
  createPatient(input: $input) {
    patient {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

```json
{
  "input": {
    "first_name": "Henrietta",
    "last_name": "Lacks"
  }
}
```

### List patients

Let's make sure that Henrietta is in our list of patients. We can use the List Patients request to see the patient IDs of patients in your tenant.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/list-patients"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for patients query"
>
  Open API reference for patients query
</a>

There is no input required for this request. Go ahead and run it and you will see the id from earlier is included in the patients array.

### Start pathway

Now that Henrietta is safely in our system, we would like her to be included in our shiny new BMI Assessment pathway that was created in the Studio.

<a
  href="/api-reference/mutations/start-pathway"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for start pathway mutation"
>
  Open API reference for start pathway mutation
</a>

> Before doing this, please ensure that the pathway has been published and that its id has been added as the PUBLISHED_PATHWAY_ID variable in the Collection Variables.
>
> Additionally, for the purposes of our demo, we have set up our test in a way that means our BMI form should only have two questions, the first is asking for the patient's height (in cm) and the second asking for the patient's weight (in kg).
>
> In practice, you can tailor your form as you like with a variety of useful question types, but for now, we're just keeping it simple!

In order to start a pathway for a patient, we need to know the following, provided within an input object:

**Let's run this query!**

```graphql
mutation startPathway($input: StartPathwayInput!) {
  startPathway(input: $input) {
    pathway_id
  }
}
```

<br />

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "pathway_definition_id": "Replace with Pathway ID"
  }
}
```

You should see a response with the `pathway_id`. This is a good moment to briefly explain the difference between a pathway definition and the pathway:

A **pathway definition** is the 'template' of the pathway that a patient can journey through and it is defined using the Studio and is made available for use in orchestration when published in the Studio. When we 'start a pathway' for a patient, we use the latest **published** version of a pathway definition. Any unpublished changes to the template are ignored.

A **pathway**, on the other hand, is an instance of this pathway **specific to a patient**. It is the pathway definition that was the latest published version at the time the pathway was started for them, and so can differ between patients depending on when they started their care journey.

The response returns us the id of a pathway. We will no longer be using the pathway definition as that lives in the world of pathway design. The orchestration has begun! Let's see what's next for Henrietta.

### Get pending activities

Now here's a query that we use in our patient app, Awell MyCare. It allows the app to show Henrietta what activities are pending for her. We will use this query a few times in this tutorial to keep track of "What's next?" - this question is fundamental to what we do at Awell. So... what's next?

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-pending-activities"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for pending activities query"
>
  Open API reference for pending activities query
</a>

As you can see, the query has no inputs. However, we need to specify which patient's pending activities we want to see. We can pass this information in via the request Header, using the `X-User-ID` key.

In response, we receive an array of pending activities, with additional details. These are:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>stream_id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the pathway definition id</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the activity id</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>status</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the status of the activity</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>action</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the related action</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>date</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>date of the activity being activated</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>object</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the activity object (e.g. message, form)</td>
      <td>object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>object.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the activity object</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>object.type</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the type of the activity object (FORM, MESSAGE, CHECKLIST, etc)</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>object.name</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the name of the activity object as defined in the Studio</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

What is an **activity** though? In the orchestration context, an activity is fundamental unit of orchestration. It represents actions that an actor in the care journey is primarily responsible for to progress the patient along their path. An example of an actor could be the patient themselves (e.g. filling in a form), a care team member (e.g. a nurse completing a checklist), or a system (e.g. Awell Orchestration triggering a new step or the Awell Score API computing a calculation).

> As an aside, activities also have sub-activities, which represent how multiple actors play a part in the activity (it's a team game after all!). For a patient message activity, sub-activities would include Awell sending the message to the patient, the patient receiving the message, and the patient reading the message. Subactivity details are not included in this response however.

Back to our pending activities, we can see there is one pending activity for Henrietta - a BMI form to fill in. Let's get the details of this form so we can let her fill it in.

### Get form details

We can fetch the form Henrietta needs to fill in with this query. We just need to specify the id of the form. We have that information from the pending activities we saw earlier so let's use that.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-form"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for form details query"
>
  Open API reference for form details query
</a>

Run the query, and you can see in the response that we have some of the following data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the form id</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>title</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the title of the form</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>questions</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the collection of individual questions within a form</td>
      <td>array of question objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of a question</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question.title</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the title of the question (e.g. What is your weight in kg?)</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question.dataPointValueType</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the type of values that the question expects in response</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>question.questionType</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>
        the type of question (e.g. multiple choice, date input, free text input)
      </td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>options</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>
        for non-free-form answers, the options array will contain all possible
        choices
      </td>
      <td>array of option objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>option.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the option</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>option.value</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the value of the option as coded in the Studio Form Builder</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>option.label</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the human-readable label of the option</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Our two questions in the form expect numbers to be provided in response. You will also see an empty options array, as there are no options associated with these questions. In other words, the patient will not be choosing from some options. If we had a multiple-choice question, the set of options to choose from would be specified here.

Now that we have the information to show Henrietta the form, let's assume she's filled them in and we need to handle submitting her responses.

### Submit form response

Let's send Henrietta's responses back to Awell Orchestration so it can decide what happens next.

<a
  href="/api-reference/mutations/submit-form-response"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for submit form response mutation"
>
  Open API reference for submit form response mutation
</a>

We also need to include the id of the stakeholder who completed the form in the request header (as we did for the pending pathway activities request). In this request we will use Henrietta's patient id.

Send the request and you can see in the response that we have some of the following data:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the activity's navigation id</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>status</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the updated status of the activity (e.g. "DONE")</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Excellent! Henrietta can now go about her day knowing that the form has successfully been submitted. Let's assume that, for some reason, her care team wants to be able to see the responses that she's submitted so let's get her form responses to do that.

### Get submitted form answers

We can use this query to get the responses for a particular form.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-form-response"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for form response query"
>
  Open API reference for submit form response query
</a>

Send the request and you can see in the response that we have objects with the following structure in the answers array:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>question_id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the question</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>value</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the value of the question answer</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>value_type</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the type of the question answer (e.g. "NUMBER")</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Perfect! Henrietta's care team can see her responses to the BMI form and in the background we've been orchestrating our other players in her care journey. So what's happening?

So that we can eventually send a message to Henrietta with her BMI score, we first need to calculate what it is. For this particular pathway, we created a Calculation activity to do this, that takes place right after the form is submission is received. Awell Calculation activities use our [CE-marked Score API](https://score.awellhealth.com/) and in this case we will use the [BMI calculator](https://score.awellhealth.com/calculations/bmi).

With the score now calculated, the next activity is triggered and a BMI score message is generated and sent to Henrietta. But how do we know if it is ready for her to read? We can see if Henrietta has any pending activities!

### Get pending activities

We revisit this query, which as a reminder, allows us to see the activities that are pending for a particular user. Here, we want to see what Henrietta has to do (spoiler alert: it's a message she has to read) so let's take a look.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-pending-activities"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for pending activities query"
>
  Open API reference for submit form response query
</a>

Remember, the request header needs to specify the `X-User-ID` (we pass in her patient id here) in order to work as intended.

In response, we can see that the form activity is gone (its status is DONE) and she has one new activity, our expected message. Great, let's go get that message and show it to her!

### Get message details

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-message"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for message query"
>
  Open API reference for message query
</a>

Fire off the request and you can see in the response that we have the following fields:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the message activity</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>body</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the stringified HTML body of the message</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>format</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the format of the message (HTML or Slate)</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>subject</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the subject (or title) of the message</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>attachments</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the message attachments</td>
      <td>an array of attachment objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>attachment.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the attachment</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>attachment.name</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the label of the attachment</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>attachment.url</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the url of the attachment</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>attachment.type</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the type of message attachment</td>
      <td>string, one of FILE, VIDEO or LINK</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

With this data we can show Henrietta her BMI score! Looks like she's not doing so great, perhaps the message also includes some advice or next steps to follow that we can share with her in the message. Certainly, in a more complex pathway she could receive different messages depending on whether her score was above or below a specified threshold. Here we're keeping it simple, she gets the same message in all cases.

So what's next? That's the end of her short journey?

### Mark message as read

Hang on! Before we can proceed, we need to ensure that she's seen all of this information!

To do that, we want to track whether Henrietta has at least opened the message, or even explicitly hit a button to confirm that she has read its contents. When that happens, we can tell Awell Orchestration that the message has been read.

<a
  href="/api-reference/mutations/mark-message-as-read"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for mark message as read mutation"
>
  Open API reference for mark message as read mutation
</a>

The response should show us the following fields:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the message activity</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>status</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the updated status of the message activity</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The updated status indicates that we have confirmed that Henrietta has read the message. If we think back to our (short) pathway for this quick start, we should be very close to the end now as we've completed all the actions we defined in the pathway (form, calculation, message). Let's be sure we didn't miss anything and that the pathway is truly complete!

### Get pending activities

Third time's a charm, let's check Henrietta's pending activities with this now-familiar query.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-pending-activities"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for pending activities query"
>
  Open API reference for submit form response query
</a>

With our custom request header set, we can make our request. The response should confirm that there are no pending activities for Henrietta. Sit back and relax, Hen, you did great!

Finally, let's introduce one last query to make sure that her (and our) pathway journey is truly complete.

### Get pathway activities

We have confirmed that there is nothing left for Henrietta to do but what if there's a task for someone else in her care team? We want to confirm that all activities have been resolved and that the pathway has been orchestrated to its completion. In other words, we want to be sure that Henrietta has both completed her tasks **and** has completed her care journey.

This last query lets us fetch all of the pathway activities for a specific orchestrated pathway. In there we'll find our answer.

<a
  href="/api-reference/queries/get-pathway-activities"
  class="button"
  target="_blank"
  title="Open API reference for pathway activities query"
>
  Open API reference for submit pathway activities query
</a>

The response should show us the following fields:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Nullable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>success</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>whether the request was successful</td>
      <td>boolean</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activities</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the collection of pathway activities</td>
      <td>array of activity objects</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.stream_id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the orchestrated pathway</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the activity</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.status</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>
        the current state of the activity (e.g. ACTIVE, DONE, FAILED, CANCELED)
      </td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.action</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>
        the current system action associated with the activity (e.g. SEND,
        COMPUTED, ACTIVATE)
      </td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.date</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the date the activity was started</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.object</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the activity object, which describes the activity itself</td>
      <td>object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.object.id</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the id of the activity object</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.object.type</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the type of object (e.g. MESSAGE, FORM, PATHWAY)</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>activity.object.name</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>the name or title of the object</td>
      <td>string</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Looking through these activities, we can see that one of the activities is for an object of type PATHWAY, with the action to COMPLETE the pathway and -- hurrah! -- its status is DONE. That's just a very definitive way of saying that we've completed Henrietta's care journey.

> Note that this list of activities is exhaustive. Whereas the query for pending activities we saw earlier focuses on human-actionable work to be done, this query includes 'system' activities like the aforementioned pathway completion activity and automated actions like the calculation activity.

Congratulations! You've successfully orchestrated your first pathway with Henrietta and Awell Orchestration. This is just the tip of the iceberg for what the Awell Orchestration API can do and we would be delighted if you wanted to see more.

So... what's next? You can dive into our growing list of resources to learn more, or if you have any queries (no pun intended), suggestions or corrections please get in touch with us. We'd be delighted to hear from you, and together help you help your patients.
