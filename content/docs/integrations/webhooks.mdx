title: Webhooks
description: Webhooks are a powerful resource that you can use to notify your system when actions are happening in a pathway.
---

Webhooks can be configured to automatically notify your system when something has happened in the pathway, such as an activity that is completed or a form that is submitted.

## Webhook configuration

Webhooks can be configured on a per pathway basis in the Awell Studio (see `Settings > Webhooks`). See our Awell Studio documentation on how to configure Webhooks.

## Subscriptions

**Webhooks are automatically subscribed to the following events**:

1. <u>Activity created:</u> triggered every time an activity in the pathway is created,
   including system activities.
2. <u>Activity completed:</u> triggered every time an activity in the pathway is
   completed, including system activities.{' '}
3. <u>Data point collected:</u> triggered every time a new value for a data point
   is collected
4. <u>Form submitted:</u> triggered every time a form is submitted

> Note that every Webhook is automatically subscribed to the above events. You can currently not change the subscriptions on a per webhook basis.

## Example payloads
