title: Webhooks
description: Webhooks are a powerful resource that you can use to notify your system when actions are happening in a pathway.
---

Unlike the API resources, which represent static data that you can create, update and retrieve as needed, webhooks represent dynamic resources. You can configure them to automatically notify you when something has happened in the pathway, such as an activity that is completed or a form that is filled in.
