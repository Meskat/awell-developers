Awell offers you a tool to build and operate clinical works. As explained on the "[Awell ecosystem](/docs/getting-started/awell-ecosystem)" page, you use Awell Studio to build these workflows and Awell Orchestration to operate or run these workflows.

The definition of a monthly active patient (MAP) is based on whether a workflow was operated for a given patient. **This means that you're not billed for the use of Awell Studio, but only for Awell Orchestration.**

## Operating a clinical workflow

Whenever Awell Orchestration operates a clinical workflow, it processes the pathway built in Awell Studio (i.e. the pathway definition) and translates it to a set of activities that represent the pathway of an individual patient. We added an example below to illustrate this.

## What is an active patient?

**An active patient is a patient for which one or more activities were generated by Awell Orchestration during a given month**, such as pathway started, track activated, step completed and reminder sent. You can find the full list of activities below as well as an example.

## Example

### Pathway in Awell Studio

Let's take a look at a simple, single track BMI pathway built in Awell Studio.

  />
  <figcaption className="dark:text-slate-400 pt-1">

</figure>

The pathway above only has a single step with 2 actions in it: a form and a calculation. Let's assume we also configured reminders in the pathway that are triggered after 15 days for pending actions.

### Operating via Awell Orchestration

When the above pathway is published, it can be operated for a patient by Awell Orchestration. The Orchestrator processes the pathway definition built in Awell Studio and translates it to a set of activities. The activities for our pathway would look like this:

  />
  <figcaption className="dark:text-slate-400 pt-1">
    We included a patient in our BMI pathway on June 30
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**When applying the above definition for an active patient, the patient would be considered active in:**

- June: the pathway was started and we activated the first action (BMI form)
- July: Awell Orchestration triggered a reminder because patient did not complete the form
- August: the pathway calculated the BMI of the patient

## List of activities

When a pathway definition (i.e. a pathway built in Awell Studio) is operated by Awell Orchestration, it is translated to a set of activities. Below you can find the categories of activities and the activities themselves a pathway is composed of.

### Pathway related activities

- Pathway started/activated
- Pathway completed
- Pathway stopped

### Track related activities

- Track activated
- Track completed

### Step related activities

- Step scheduled
- Step activated
- Step completed

### Action-related activities

- Action activated

> Note: there's no separate activity for actions that are getting completed. These are registered as subactivities on the original (activated) activity.

### Reminder related activities

- Reminder sent
