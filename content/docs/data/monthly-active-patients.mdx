Awell offers you a tool to build and operate clinical workflows. As explained on the "[Awell ecosystem](/docs/getting-started/awell-ecosystem)" page, you use Awell Studio to build these workflows and Awell Orchestration to operate or run these workflows.

The definition of a monthly active patient (MAP) is based on whether an activity in a workflow was orchestrated for a given patient. **This means that you're not billed for the use of Awell Studio, only for Awell Orchestration.**

## Operating a clinical workflow

Whenever Awell Orchestration operates a clinical workflow, it processes the flow built in Awell Studio and translates it to a set of activities that represent the pathway of an individual patient. We added an example below to illustrate this.

## What is an active patient?

**A patient is active if Awell Orchestration performed at least one of the following activities for that patient:**

- Pathway was started or completed
- Action was activated
- Reminder was triggered

Please note that the patient does not need to have been active themselves. For example, the sending of a reminder marks that patient as active.

## Example

### Flow in Awell Studio

Let's take a look at a simple, single track BMI pathway built in Awell Studio.

</figure>

The pathway above only has a single step with 2 actions in it: a form and a calculation. Let's assume we also configured reminders in the pathway that are triggered after 15 days for pending actions.

### Operating via Awell Orchestration

When the above pathway is published, it can be operated for a patient by Awell Orchestration. Awell Orchestration processes the pathway definition built in Awell Studio and translates it to a set of activities. The activities for our pathway would look like this:

</figure>

**When applying the above definition for an active patient, the patient would be considered active in:**

- June: the pathway was started and we activated the first action (BMI form)
- July: Awell Orchestration triggered a reminder because patient did not complete the form
- August: the pathway calculated the BMI of the patient and the pathway was completed

**Other notes to take into account:**

- Whether Awell Orchestration operated 1 or 1000 activities for a given patient in a given month, that patient will be billed only once in that month. This means we do not disincentivise you from building pathways with many activities, on the contrary.
- To avoid billing twice for the same action, we only take activation of an action into account. If a form has been made available for a patient in June but submitted in July, that patient will be billed only in June
