## Variables

### Filters

All filter values are optional, if you don't provide any filter all activities in your tenant will be returned.

All `in` filters accept a list of values and result in an `is any of` search criteria. The `eq` filter accepts a single string and results in `is exact match` search criteria.

When specifying multiple filters, the resulting criteria is the conjuction of all filters.

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "action": {
      "in": []
    },
    "activity_status": {
      "in": []
    },
    "activity_type": {
      "in": []
    },
    "pathway_definition_id": {
      "in": []
    },
    "patient_id": {
      "eq": ""
    }
  }
}
```
