title: Get pathway elements
description: Query all the elements or building blocks of a pathway
---

Where pathway activities represent every granular activity related to the operation or orchestration of a pathway, Elements are the building blocks of a pathway represented by their logical (e.g. this step belongs to a parent track) and chronological (e.g. this step's completion date depends on when all its child actions are completed) dependencies.

## Elements of a pathway

By reflecting dependencies between the pathway building blocks, Elements allow us to reflect a pathway's overall shape. This means we can generate a clear picture of not just when we are (as with activities), but where we are in the lifespan of an orchestrated pathway. This makes them perfect for constructing Gantt or Timeline-style views that give users high-level or granular views of a patient's progress through a care flow.

**A pathway consists of the following elements:**

- Pathway
- Tracks
- Steps
- Actions
- Triggers (not yet supported in the query)

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayElements($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayElements(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    elements {
      id
      parent_id
      name
      status
      type
      activity_type
      start_date
      end_date
      label {
        id
        color
        text
      }
      stakeholders {
        id
        name
      }
      context {
        instance_id
        pathway_id
        track_id
        step_id
        action_id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID}}"
}
```

## Timeline view

We use the `pathwayElements` query ourselves to render a timeline representation of pathways. There are a multitude of timeline and gannt libraries out there but we've used [DHTMLX Gantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/).
