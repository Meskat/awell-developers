title: Get pathway elements
description: Query all the elements or building blocks of a pathway
---

Where pathway activities represent every granular activity related to the operation or orchestration of a pathway. The pathway elements query allows you to query the main elements or building blocks of a patient's pathway and their status. It's essentially a different lens to look at a pathway and can be useful to create specific types of visualizations like a timeline view.

## Elements of a pathway

**A pathway consists of the following elements:**

- Pathway
- Tracks
- Steps
- Actions
- Triggers (not yet supported in the query)

There is hierarchy to elements. An action's parent is a Step. A Step's parent is a Track. A Track's parent is a Pathway. In other words, `Pathway -> Track -> Step -> Action`. Pathways, being the largest unit of pathway definition themselves, do not have parents.
## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayElements($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayElements(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    elements {
      id
      parent_id // id of this element's parent. one of `pathway_id`, `track_id` or `step_id` from the context object below
      name
      status // one of 'active', 'done' or 'scheduled'
      type // one of 'pathway', 'track', 'step', 'action' or 'trigger'
      activity_type // one of 'api_call', 'calculation', 'checklist', 'form', 'message' or 'push_to_emr'
      start_date
      end_date // for a completed element, this is the completion date of the final action element in it
      stakeholders {
        id
        name
      }
      context {
        instance_id
        pathway_id
        track_id
        step_id
        action_id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID}}"
}
```

## Timeline view

We use the `pathwayElements` query ourselves to render a timeline representation of pathways. There are a multitude of timeline and gantt libraries out there but we've used [DHTMLX Gantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/).
