title: Get pathway elements
description: Query all the elements (tracks, steps, actions) in a pathway
---

Where pathway activities represent every granular activity related to the operation or orchestration of a pathway. The pathway elements query allows you to query the main elements or building blocks of a patient's pathway and their status. It's essentially a different lens to look at a pathway and can be useful to create specific types of visualizations like a timeline view.

## Elements of a pathway

**A pathway consists of the following elements:**

- Pathway
- Tracks
- Steps
- Actions
- Triggers (not yet supported in the query)

## Request

### Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayElements($pathway_id: String!) {
  pathwayElements(pathway_id: $pathway_id) {
    elements {
      id
      parent_id
      name
      status
      type
      activity_type
      start_date
      end_date
      label {
        id
        color
        text
      }
      stakeholders {
        id
        name
      }
      context {
        instance_id
        pathway_id
        track_id
        step_id
        action_id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "pathway_id": "{{PATIENT_PATHWAY_ID}}"
}
```

## Timeline view

We use the `pathwayElements` query ourselves to render a timeline representation of pathways. There are a multitude of timeline and gannt libraries out there but we've used [DHTMLX Gantt](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/).
