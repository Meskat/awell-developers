**Before you're able to make API calls to our Orchestration API, you'll have to set your API key in the "Request headers" pane** which is located at the bottom of the Playground.

You can copy and paste the below snippet and replace `{{YOUR_API_KEY}}` with your API key.

```json
{
  "apiKey": "{{YOUR_API_KEY}}"
}
```
