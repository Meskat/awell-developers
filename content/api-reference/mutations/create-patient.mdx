## Request

### Query

```graphql
mutation CreatePatient($input: CreatePatientInput!) {
  createPatient(input: $input) {
    patient {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Variables

Use our GraphQL explorer to discover all the variables you can pass with this mutation.

```json
{
  "input": {
    "first_name": "{{PATIENT FIRST NAME}}",
    "last_name": "{{PATIENT LAST NAME}}",
    "patient_code": "{{PATIENT CODE}}",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Support for anonymous patients

As all of the input fields are optional, this means, in effect, that you can create anonymous patients should you need to. For example, you can begin a patient journey with no details provided except an internal patient_code reference and use the generated patient ID to progress them through a pathway until such time you wish to gather and update their personal details.

To create an anonymous patient you thus use the same mutation and you leave the `input` object empty. Leaving the `input` object out completely will not work.

```json
{
  "input": {}
}
```
