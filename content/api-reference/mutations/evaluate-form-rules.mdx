title: Evaluate form rules
description: Evaluate what question needs to be shown next
---

This query allows us to evaluate the form state based on the answers to questions provided so far and see whether the criteria for a specific question has been met (i.e. 'satisfied') or not.

For example, if a question should only be shown if the previous question's answer is true, we can evaluate the form state after the user selects an answer to that question to decide whether to show the next question or keep it hidden.
