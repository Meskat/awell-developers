description: Start a new pathway for a given patient

When starting a pathway, the orchestration API automatically chooses the most recent published version of the pathway to use.

## Prerequisites to start a pathway

Keep in mind that, if your pathway has baseline pathway data points, the pathway will not be initiated until all non-optional baseline data points have a value. You can use the `publishedPathwayDefinitions` query (see documentation [here](https://developers.awellhealth.com/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways)) to get the baseline pathway data points of a pathway as well as seeing whether they are required or optional (through the `optional` field).

```graphql
query GetPublishedPathwayDefinitions {
  publishedPathwayDefinitions {
    publishedPathwayDefinitions {
      id
      title
      dataPointDefinitions {
        id
        key
        valueType
        optional # if not set to "true" then baseline data point is required
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Request

### Query

```graphql
mutation StartPathway($input: StartPathwayInput!) {
  startPathway(input: $input) {
    pathway_id
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}",
    "data_points": [
      {
        "data_point_definition_id": "{{DATA_POINT_DEFINITION_ID}}",
        "value": "{{DATA_POINT_VALUE}}"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

> Note that `data_points` is only needed when you want to pass baseline data point values to your pathway on pathway start. Keep in mind that, if your pathway has required baseline data points, it will not start until all required baseline data points have a value.
