title: Start pathway
description: Start a new pathway for a given patient
---

When starting a pathway, the orchestration API automatically chooses the most recent published version of the pathway to use.

## Prerequisites to start a pathway

Keep in mind that, if your pathway has baseline pathway data points, the pathway will not be initiated until all non-optional baseline data points have a value. You can use the `publishedPathwayDefinitions` query (see documentation [here](https://developers.awellhealth.com/api-reference/queries/get-published-pathways)) to get the baseline pathway data points of a pathway as well as seeing whether they are required or optional (through the `optional` field).

```graphql
query publishedPathwayDefinitions {
  publishedPathwayDefinitions {
    publishedPathwayDefinitions {
      id
      title
      dataPointDefinitions {
        id
        key
        valueType
        optional # if not set to "true" then baseline data point is required
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Request

### Query

```graphql
mutation startPathway($input: StartPathwayInput!) {
  startPathway(input: $input) {
    pathway_id
  }
}
```

### Variables

```json
{
  "input": {
    "patient_id": "{{PATIENT_ID}}",
    "pathway_definition_id": "{{PATHWAY_DEFINITION_ID}}"
  }
}
```

To start a pathway for a patient, the request needs the following, provided within an input object:

<div className="table-wrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Required</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Type</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>patient_id</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>the id of the patient</td>
        <td>string</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>pathway_definition_id</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>the id of the published pathway</td>
        <td>string</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
